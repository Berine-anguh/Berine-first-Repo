        <h2 ><u><center><marquee>MY FAVOURITE MEAL IS <MARK>ACHU</MARK> AND YELLOW SOUP</marquee></center></u></h2>
        <h3 style="border: 2px solid tomato; border-radius: 20px;">A)	Achu</h3>
        <p><mark>Achu</mark> is the traditional meal of a number of villages in the North West region of Cameroon which includes my village <q>AWING</q> too. This meal can be prepared in so many occasions, furthermore could equally be prepared to pay a visit. We the Awingâ€™s mostly have varieties of cocoyam used in the preparation. Few of this below could be used;
            White cocoyam, red cocoyam, etc.
            Below are the steps used in preparing <mark>Achu</mark>.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>	The dug cocoyam from the farmland is been washed,</li>
            <li>	Then later on place it on fire after the washing,</li>
            <li>	Mark it above the cocoyam in the pot with clean/distilled water,</li>
            <li>	Allow it to get boil for 45 mins. </li>
            <li>	Now getting to the end point, banana is been added to the cocoyam.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The addition of the banana at that time is to make it get ready at the same time with the <mark>Achu</mark>, but in case the cocoyam gets ready when the banana was not put on time, the banana will need a proper boiling on its own.
            After all is ready, requirements like mortar, pistle, etc for the pounding of the <mark>Achu</mark>.
            </p>
